# Hello, I'm @egghao ðŸ‘‹

I am a dedicated software engineer specializing in Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Computer Vision. I thrive on merging cutting-edge algorithms with robust hardware solutions to build innovative products that address real-world challenges.

## What I Do
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning:**  
  I design, develop, and optimize advanced ML/DL models to tackle complex problems, ranging from image classification to object detection. My work emphasizes model efficiency, robust performance, and deployment on edge devices.

- **Computer Vision:**  
  I create and refine real-time object detection pipelines, enhancing performance with low latency and high accuracy. My projects integrate state-of-the-art computer vision techniques, including utilizing 3D Gaussian Splatting to construct indoor spaces for [Xplorer](https://www.homee.ai/xplorer) and implementing real-time object detection for product deployment. This work not only supports the company's expansion into new manufacturing domains but has also contributed to award-winning achievements, such as the AI AOI application recognized in the [AI Award Best Solution](https://www.favite.com/news/%e6%99%b6%e5%bd%a9%e7%a7%91%e6%8a%80ai-aoi%e6%87%89%e7%94%a8-%e7%8d%b2%e9%81%b8ai-award-best-solution%ef%bc%81/).


## Skills & Technologies
- **Languages:** Python, C/C++, CUDA, Swift
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, TensorRT
- **MLOps:** Tensorboard, MLflow, W&B
- **Hardware:** NVIDIA GPUs
- **Expertise:** Algorithm design, optimization, quantization-aware training, latency reduction, and robust system integration
